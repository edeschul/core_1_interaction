		I grew up in a small beach town in Northern California called Pacifica. I was surrounded by friends and classmates who surfed all the time. I however didn't begin surfing until I was in high school. I remember the fisrt time I went surfing, I felt intimidated but extremely excited and eager. My first time wasn't too successful obviously, but I was able to stand on the board once and ride a wave to shore! It was a magnificent feeling that made me fall in love with the sport. Since then, I sometimes surf with my sister and/or my friends.</p>
